# chat-summary

Use this library to get a summary of results of internet games (like Wordle) in a group chat.

![Tests](https://github.com/samirg1/ALTER-SMX-Tool/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

### Requirements
- Only works on MacOS iMessages
- Must have messages stored on iCloud (or on Mac)
- Only works for group chats
- Having contacts synced to your Mac is not essential but allows for better viewage of results

### Installation 
```python
pip install chat-summary 
```

### Usage
```python
chat-summary user chat_name [options]
```

#### Options
- user (required): The name of the user ('your user' from above)
- chat_name (required): The name given to the messages group chat
- --silence-contacts: Silecne the "unable to find contacts" error
- '-C', '--Connections': Include the 'Connections' game in the results
- '-N', '--Nerdle': Include the 'Nerdle' game in the results
- '-W', '--Wordle': Include the 'Wordle' game in the results

### Output
If all goes well, for each game you opt-in to you will be shown an output like this:
```
ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ {game} ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¨

COMPLETIONS ({n} days)
1. *********..{c}/{a}
2. *******....{c}/{a}
3. ******.....{c}/{a}
...

AVERAGE GUESSES
1. *********..{av}
2. *******....{av}
3. ******.....{av}
...
```
Where:
- {game} is the name of the game
- {n} is the total amount of {game}s between the first message with {game} and the last
- '******' are replaced by either the contact name or phone numbers of each group chat member (depending on whether contacts are available)
- {c} is the amount of {game}s this person has completed (won)
- {a} is the amount of {game}s this person has attempted
- {av} is the average amount of guesses this person used in a 'win' of {game}
- Completions are sorted from most completed ({c}) to least completed
- Average guesses are sorted from lowest to highest

If there are no messages for a particular game that you have opted-in to you will see something like this instead:
```
ðŸŸ¥ no '{game}' messages found ðŸŸ¥
```
Where {game} is replaced by the game that there were no messages for.

### Errors

- ```"invalid user, user not found"```
    - user parameter was invalid, check that you've spelt it correctly and that you are a valid user in the ```\Users``` directory
-  ```"could not connect to messages database, ensure you have the right permissions to access file"```
    - Ensure there is a `chat.db` file in `\Users\{your user}\Library\Messages`, if not your messages are not stored locally on your Mac, try logging in to iMessage on your Mac
    - Ensure you have the right permissions to view the `chat.db` by going System Preferences > Securiy & Privacy > Full Disk Access and ensure that Terminal (or whatever you are using to run the script) is ticked
- ```"chat name not found"```
    - you have entered an invalid chat_name argument that doesn't match up with any group chats you are currently in on iMessage
    - ensure you've spelt this parameter correctly and that you can verify on your Mac's iMessage app that you can see this group chat
- ```"unable to find contacts"```
    - not a destructive error, means that the program could not find contacts that were stored on your computer, so instead of displaying people's names it will instead display their phone numbers in the summary, silence this warning with the `--silence-contacts option`
    - the program will look for a `'AddressBook-v22.abcddb'` file somewhere in `'/Users/{your user}/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources'`
